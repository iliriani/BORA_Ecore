# Model Processing and Evaluation Workflow

This project provides a workflow for processing models, merging them, and evaluating class and attribute similarity using RDF and cross-validation methods.

## Steps

### 1. Convert Models to RDF

Convert your models into RDF format for compatibility with the subsequent steps.

### 2. Use Cross-Validation for Folder Splitting

Set up folder splitting for cross-validation evaluation:
```java
CrossValidationFolderSetup folderSetup = new CrossValidationFolderSetup();
folderSetup.splitFolders("path/to/data");
