This repository provides a workflow for processing models, merging them, and evaluating class and attribute similarity using RDF and cross-validation methods.

# Evaluation Process
## 1. Convert models to RDF
Use Classes like Json2RDf, XML2Rdf to convert different models to the specific RDF format.

## 2. Use CrossValidationFolderSetup to split folders for evaluation. Currently, 80% of the models are split for training and 20% for testing.

## 2. Merge Models:

		RDFMerge m = new RDFMerge();
		m.iterate();
		
		
## 3. Create Repo by using an initial model and the destination
""""
		  String repoTest = "path_to_repo";
		  String repoTrain = "path_to_repo";
		  
		  EvaluationForKfoldValidation comp = new EvaluationForKfoldValidation(repoTrain);

		  comp.createRepo("path_to_repo\\AccessComponent.bo (2).rdf",repoTest);
""""



## 4. Insert Weights:
			AddWeights w = new AddWeights(repoTrain);
			w.insertAllWeight();
		
		
## 5. Run the evaluation:
EvaluationForKfoldValidation comp = new EvaluationForKfoldValidation(repoTrain);
-For class name similarity evaluation
com.compare(repoTest, repoTrain)

-For attribute similarity evaluation
comp.compareAtttributeAndRelations(repoTest, repoTrain);
